# DS002-ide-plugin-contracts

## Introduction

This specification defines the active contract for multimedia.

## Core Content

### DS02 - IDE Plugin Contracts

### Role of This Document

This document defines integration contracts for IDE plugins published by the `multimedia` agent.

### Requirements

Requirement U1: every published plugin must include a valid `config.json` with `pluginCategory`, `component`, `presenter`, `type`, and appropriate icon/tooltips.

Requirement U2: plugins must work in document/chapter/paragraph context using host-provided context (`data-context`).

Requirement U3: attachment-mutating actions must persist data through `document` module APIs and/or `commandsEditor`.

Requirement U4: media uploads must enforce size limits and metadata extraction (duration, dimensions), with visible user interface (UI) feedback.

Requirement U5: preview plugins must support sequential scene playback with audio/video/image/silence combinations.

Requirement U6: task orchestration plugins (for example document video actions) must expose live status for async tasks.

### Constraints

Constraint Q1: plugins must not assume private host dependencies; integration must use the stable Explorer surface.

Constraint Q2: host-side visual changes must not impact attachment persistence behavior.

Constraint Q3: upload/metadata errors must be handled explicitly and surfaced with useful messages.

### Invariants

Invariant I1: the attachment data model remains serializable in `commands` / `mediaAttachments`.

Invariant I2: the upload flow is `validate -> metadata -> upload -> persist -> invalidate UI`.

Invariant I3: media plugins remain the primary value channel of the agent.

## Conclusion

multimedia must preserve the responsibilities, boundaries, and observable results stated in this specification.
