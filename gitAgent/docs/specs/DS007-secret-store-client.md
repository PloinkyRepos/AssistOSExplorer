# DS007-secret-store-client

## Introduction

This specification defines the active contract for gitAgent.

## Core Content

### DS06 — DPU-aware secret-store client

### Summary

`gitAgent` is explicitly coupled to `dpuAgent`. It uses the client at `lib/secret-store-client.mjs` to call DPU through the router over a single JSON-RPC `tools/call` per operation. User-owned GitHub token operations require a router-minted `dpuGitSecrets` User Delegation Grant carried on `authInfo.delegations`; the client forwards that grant as `x-ploinky-user-delegation` while authenticating itself with a DS013 Agent Assertion. No capability binding lookup and no MCP session setup.

### Client behavior

`lib/secret-store-client.mjs` uses Ploinky's shared `AgentMcpClient` for each direct tool call. That client:

- resolves the DPU route name from `PLOINKY_DPU_ROUTE`, defaulting to
`dpuAgent`
- requires the current router-issued invocation JWT to prove the Git call is
running inside a routed workspace invocation
- extracts the configured `dpuGitSecrets` delegation from `authInfo.delegations`
for user-owned GitHub token reads, writes, grants, and deletes
- signs a DS013 Agent Assertion with `PLOINKY_AGENT_SECRET` and sends it as
`Authorization: Bearer <assertion>` to the router
- POSTs a single JSON-RPC `tools/call` request to
`{router}/{dpuRoute}/mcp`
- delegates Router transport and canonical authority verification to the mounted
`AgentMcpClient` descriptor client, so the Git agent owns no direct Router socket or protected transport override
- calls authenticated DPU `dpu_secret_*` tools when the user delegation is
present
- calls only canonical DPU operations; no internal alias or repair path exists

No MCP `Client`/`Transport` setup is used. No `mcp-session-id` header is sent. Errors from DPU are surfaced as thrown `Error`s.

### Helpers

Exported and used by `github-auth.mjs`:

- `getStoredGitToken({ key })`
- `putStoredGitToken({ token, key })` — writes a user-owned DPU secret and
grants the calling agent `read` after writing
- `deleteStoredGitToken({ key })`
- `grantStoredGitTokenAccess({ key, principal, role })`

When callers use the default GitHub token key, helpers derive a user-scoped DPU key from the routed invocation identity:

- `GIT_GITHUB_TOKEN_<16-char SHA-256 suffix>` when a workspace user or
caller principal is available
- `GIT_GITHUB_TOKEN` only when no routed identity is available

Reads, writes, and deletes target only the resolved key. They do not probe, overwrite, or remove another global token secret. Guest callers do not receive delegations; status-style reads return no stored token and writes/deletes fail with an explicit sign-in-required error.

### Delegated user propagation

`git_tool.mjs` reads the verified `metadata.invocation` grant, exposes `authInfo.delegations`, and preserves the raw `metadata.invocationToken`. The secret-store client uses that presence check to reject out-of-band secret access, then authenticates the Git-to-DPU hop with an Agent Assertion signed by `gitAgent`'s own `PLOINKY_AGENT_SECRET`. `gitAgent` never mints a DPU-audience invocation token or a User Delegation Grant.

Chain of custody:

- browser or first-party route authenticates the workspace user
- router issues an invocation JWT to `gitAgent` with `aud` pinned to
`agent:<repo>/gitAgent`; for configured GitHub auth tools, the same Router Request includes a plural `delegations.dpuGitSecrets` entry
- `gitAgent` derives the user-scoped token key from that verified invocation
and signs an Agent Assertion for the authenticated DPU secret tool
- router verifies the source agent assertion and the source-bound
`x-ploinky-user-delegation`, applies MCP policy, and mints a fresh Router Request with `aud` pinned to `agent:<repo>/dpuAgent`, `usr` set to the original user, and singular `delegation` metadata describing the grant used
- DPU verifies the Router Request before exposing `metadata.invocation` to
domain code

### Scope contract

| Git client operation | Normal delegated DPU tool | Delegation scope / role |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| read stored token | `dpu_secret_get` | `secret:read` / `read` |
| write stored token | `dpu_secret_put` | `secret:write` / owner write |
| delete stored token | `dpu_secret_delete` | `secret:write` / owner write |
| grant gitAgent token read | `dpu_secret_grant` | `secret:grant` / capped to `read` |

The router normally permits agents to call only `internal` MCP tools. The DS013/DS014 delegated-user exception allows the specific source-bound GitHub auth call to reach authenticated DPU tools when the router verifies the `dpuGitSecrets` grant. DPU then enforces per-secret ACLs and `agentPolicies[<principalId>].secrets.allowedRoles`. The manifest no longer declares a `requires.secretStore` block; the client is intentionally DPU-specific.

### Clean-break behavior

The client calls only canonical `dpu_secret_*` tools. It does not delete or repair records created by retired agent-owned contracts. Access denial, missing delegation, grant failure, delete failure, and unexpected DPU transport errors remain fail-loud; `git_auth_disconnect` must not report success while the token persists.

### Agent policy

`gitAgent/manifest.json` does not declare any DPU policy. The maximum role `gitAgent` may receive on any secret is controlled by DPU-owned policy stored in `permissions.manifest.json -> agentPolicies[<principalId>].secrets.allowedRoles`, managed by DPU admins through the `dpu_agent_policy_get` / `dpu_agent_policy_set` tools.

## Conclusion

gitAgent must preserve the responsibilities, boundaries, and observable results stated in this specification.
