# DS005-explorer-integration

## Introduction

This specification defines the active contract for gitAgent.

## Core Content

### DS04 - Explorer Integration and IDE Plugin Channel

### Role of This Document

This document defines integration rules for Explorer-facing usage of `gitAgent` and IDE plugin behavior.

### Integration Position

Explorer is the user interface (UI) host. `gitAgent` is the backend Git intermediary. IDE plugin artifacts in `gitAgent/IDE-plugins/` are the UI extension channel that connects Explorer interactions to Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool calls.

### Integration Requirements

Requirement U1: Explorer-facing UI components shall call `gitAgent` through MCP application programming interfaces (APIs).

Requirement U2: Git operation decisions and execution shall remain in the agent backend, not in UI presenters.

Requirement U3: toolbar plugin integration in slot `file-exp:toolbar` shall remain documented and operational.

Requirement U4: plugin dependency components shall remain declarative through plugin configuration.

Requirement U5: asynchronous operation outcomes shall remain representable in UI state through MCP success and failure payloads.

Requirement U6: Explorer selection shall be the source of truth for Git action targeting. Selecting any file or folder inside a repository shall also select that repository for repository-level actions.

Requirement U7: repository-level pull actions may execute for a selected repository, but commit and push actions shall remain restricted to the selected files within each selected repository.

Requirement U8: autosync/autocommit scheduling shall target only repositories explicitly chosen in autosync settings and shall not infer targets from transient tree selection.

Requirement U9: when an autosync push is explicitly rejected as non-fast-forward, the plugin shall synchronize the selected repository and retry the push at most once. It shall never force-push and shall stop when synchronization conflicts or the bounded retry fails.

Requirement U10: repository status shall distinguish an active merge from unresolved conflict entries and expose Git's prepared merge message. Once all merge conflicts are resolved and staged, the commit modal shall pre-fill that message for an editable manual Commit or Commit & Push; Sync and AutoSync shall complete the merge with the prepared message before attempting another pull or push.

### Constraints

Constraint Q1: UI components are not allowed to bypass agent contracts and execute shell Git directly.

Constraint Q2: host UI refactors are not allowed to alter backend contract semantics.

Constraint Q3: plugin metadata changes are not allowed to break the declared integration slot without coordinated contract updates.

Constraint Q4: UI flows for identity, credentials, and pending Git retries are not allowed to infer a repository by taking the first discovered repository from overview data when no explicit selection exists.

### Invariants

Invariant I1: communication between Explorer and Git backend remains MCP-based.

Invariant I2: IDE plugin channel remains an integration surface, while tool contracts remain the operational source of truth.

Invariant I3: the intermediary role of `gitAgent` between Explorer intent and Git runtime remains unchanged.

Invariant I4: manual selection state and autosync repository configuration remain separate sources of truth; one cannot silently substitute for the other.

Invariant I5: autosync preserves remote history by integrating a concurrent remote update before its single push retry.

Invariant I6: clearing the conflicted-file list does not by itself mark a merge as complete; completion requires the merge commit that removes Git's active merge state.

### Validation Criteria

Validation is satisfied when Explorer-triggered plugin actions call `gitAgent` tools successfully, tool outcomes map to UI state transitions, repository targeting follows explicit selection rules, autosync runs only for explicitly configured repositories, non-fast-forward recovery remains bounded to one synchronize-and-push retry without force, and Git execution behavior remains isolated from frontend internals.

## Conclusion

gitAgent must preserve the responsibilities, boundaries, and observable results stated in this specification.
